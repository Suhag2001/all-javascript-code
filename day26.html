Relaationships 

*Generalization (Is a)
In Is a Relationship a class acquirs the properties of another calss and becomes the type of that clss . 

Is a relationship can be implemented by using Inheritance

Example : 

class Animal{}

class Dog extends Animal{}

Dog "is a" Animal
Here Dog class is sub calss and Animal is parent class 


*Association (Has a)
   In Has a relationship a class creates an object of another class and uses the properties of that class;


  Example:
  class Brain{}

  class Animal{
    brain ;
    constructor(){
      this.brain = new Brain();
    }
  }

  Animal "Has a " Brain
  Animal class can use the properties of Brain class


  There are 2 types of Association 

  -Composition 
  -Aggregation

  part of 

  ownership

  Composition :- 
  In compositon a class who uses the properties of another class is the owner of the object 

  Example :
  class Brain{}

  class Animal{
    brain ;
    constructor(){
      this.brain = new Brain();
    }
  }

  -Aggregation :-Aggregation
  In aggregation relationship a class has an object of another class but is not owner of that object  . 

  Example ;

  classs Player{
    play(){
      console.log("playing...")
    }
  }

  class Team{
     addPlayer(p){
      console.log("player added");
      p.play;
     }
  }

  class Match{
    constructor(){
      const t1 = new Team();

      const p1 = new Player();

      t1.addPlayer(p1)
    }
  }
